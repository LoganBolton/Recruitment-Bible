## Zeta Psi Pitch
There's 26 fraternities in Auburn, why should you join Alpha Sig? What makes Alpha Sigma Phi a great fraternity is that it is a place where people actually care about you. Since we have ~50 guys in the fraternity, everyone knows everyone very well. There's a social net where the borthers are able to look out for each other and hold each other accountable. 

The average fraternity in Auburn is around 100+ members. This makes it difficult to get to know every person in your fraternity, which is the whole point of a fraternity. We are able to offer a tight knit brotherhood while also having all the benefits of a SEC fraternity.

On top of our great brotherhood, we hold our values in a high priority. Our last pledge class had the highest GPA in all of Auburn. Pledgeship here is about trying to improve your character and make you the best brother possible. We are not the type of people to throw you in a basement to see how fast you can chug a handle of Fireball.
