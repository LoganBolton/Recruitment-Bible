There is a script that I've developed over the years giving house tours. You don't have to follow this exactly, but just use it as inspiration

## Walking into the house

- Poker Room
	- Talk about how we get together every week to play poker
- Pool Room
	- You can show them the pool table and how it is from 1845
		- Tie that in to the history of Alpha Sig
- Say every Wednesday we do a poker/movie night
- Say one of the things I like about the house is that you can always come to the house after classes and there's pretty much always someone here
- TV Room
	- My go to joke here is "here is our patent pending technology, the double decker couch"
		- Usually gets some laugh
	- Show them fraternity mascot, spangler
	- Show them sorority relations dog on composite
## Going to Residential Hall

- You have a little bit of time before you get to a room, so keep the conversation light and ask them some questions about themself. I normally tell them about how we have 20 rooms in the house and brothers that live in the house have a higher GPA then ones who do not.
- Make sure you have at least 2 brothers who are down for you to show their rooms off
	- You don't want them to not know you're coming and they've got drugs out or their room is trashed or something.
- Also when you pass the couch upstairs, my go to joke is "And here's the casting couch, you may recgonize it from xvideos"
	- 80% of the time it gives them a good laugh

## Going into a room
- Single room, Jack and Jill bathroom
- I typically like to compare it to a dorm and how it's similar but so much better
- Also talk about how we have a lot of guys who sign up to live here 2/3 years in a row because they like it so much

## Party Room / Backyard
- Say we can fit 200+ people in this room for parties
- Talk about how you can literally play die inside
- Backyard
	- One of the more unique features of the house
	- Where we have all our tailgates
	- Lots of privacy with the hill
