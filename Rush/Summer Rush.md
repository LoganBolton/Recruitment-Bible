Summer rush kinda sucks for us and you just have to okay with that. Usually there's about 10 brothers that stay near Auburn for the Summer. We can't really compete with frats that have 75% of their chapter near Auburn and can throw big events in the Summer. Instead, we have to focus at what we're good at and have smaller and more intimate events with rushees over the summer.

Your general goal for Summer Rush is to get to know rushees BEFORE Fall Rush. Even if they don't end up joining, it helps get our name out there to other rushees. You generally only get to see rushees at one event over the summer so I didn't end up giving out a lot of bids. 

You can be a little more liberal with handing out bids over the Summer. You can phrase it as "normally we don't like to bid people first night, but we really fw you and we want you to know that we're serious about wanting you back at the house". Rushees are pretty understanding about that. Bidding on the first night during the Fall can come off as being desperate.

CWE is the reason why 90% of rushees come to Auburn over the Summer. You need to plan every event in the summer around when CWE is. CWE lasts for two days. The first night, campers stay in the Village and not allowed to leave. Don't plan to have an event on the first night because they're not going to be able to come. 

Look on the Auburn website to see all dates of CWE and add them to your schedule
