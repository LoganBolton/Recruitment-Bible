One of the major challenges about rush is that you physically cannot do it all yourself. The key to a succesfull rush is being able to coordinate all the brothers on a common goal. 

You NEED at least one additional rush chair to help you out. Try to get rush chairs that have complementary skills. For example, I am really good at organizing and planning, but my people skills are just decent. My rush chair was really good at talking to rushees, and was not as good at staying organized. You want to delegate responsibility according to skill. I really reccomend you follow this rush chair structure

# Why Do You Need Structure?

If you do not have people delegated to help you out, you will become exhausted, I guarantee it. I know from experience. My first year as Rush Chair I did EVERYTHING myself and got completely exhausted towards the end. As a result, recruitment did not go nearly as well as I wanted. 2nd year that I was rush chair, I had a secondary rush chair to help me out and that made a huuuggggeee difference.
