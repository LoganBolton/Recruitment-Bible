Bidding rushees is not as simple as it seems. It takes some practice to tell when to bid someone, and when to wait for another night. 

## First Night Bids

Bidding someone on the first night is a viable option, but it should be avoided. I have had rushees tell me they don't want to accept bids at other frat becasue they got bidded on the first night. It can give off the impression that we are desperate to get anyone that walks in the door. 

On the other hand, if you really fw a rushee and know he would be a good fit, bidding on the first night is a way to make sure he knows that he's wanted at the fraternity. I reccomend waiting at LEAST 2.5 hours before you give out a bid. If you can, have someone ask what their thoughts on joining Asig before you bid them. If they sound iffy, then wait another night. If they plan on accepting, they will be very enthusiastic about their response.

## Shotgun Bidding

My first year as Rush Chair I tried to implement shotgun bidding to see if it would work better. Bad idea. It did not go well at all.  

If you don't know, shotgun bidding is the process of bidding almost everyone that comes to rush events. The idea is that even if 25% of rushees accept, you still get a large amount of acceptees. A lot of large frats use this technique succcesfully. 

I think the reason this works at large frats is because rushees already know what they're getting into. They know the chapter has 200+ members with a history dating back 100+ years. They know its a big party frat where they'll meet a lot of girls and get drunk. Even if there's 50 people they don't like, there's still 150 members that they can get along with. There's not really anything unique about the frat, its just a big frat and that's good enough for them

Rushees at Alpha Sig don't really understand what its like to join Alpha Sig. There's a lot of uncertainty about accepting bids. How do parties work if there's only 50 guys? Since its a smaller group, what happens if you discover 3 weeks in that you don't actually like them? For these reasons + more, rushees might feel less confident immediatley accepting. They need time to get a feel for what it's like at the frat before even thinking about bids. 

TLDR: Do not Shotgun bid. It has historically not worked well for us

## Bid Speech

Giving a bid is an art. You want to make them feel like they're wanted while at the same time not being a kiss ass. A good bid speech should mention specific things about them that you liked. Try not to make it a generic speech that could be applied to anyone. I have a brief outline of what I usually say below if you want some inspiration.

"Hey XYZ, we really appreciate you coming out to the house today. I'm not sure if you noticed, but everytime that you've talked to any of the brothers, I always come up after you and ask them what they think about you. Every brother that I've talked to has only said good things about you. They're always like "oh yeah, XYZ is really cool, definetly want him back around the house". 

As the Rush Chair I'm always looking for guys that I can see potential in. Guys that I can look at one day and be proud to say "Yeah, he's a brother at Alpha Sig". XYZ, I feel like you are one of those guys. I really think that you would make a fantastic addition this fraternity and that you have a place in this chapter."

*At this point I let someone else in the room talk*

"With that being said, XYZ, I would like to officially offer you a bid to become a member at Alpha Sigma Phi. With this bid, you have three options. First, you can decline, we shake hands, no hard feelings. Second, you can hold your bid and we give you a week to talk it over with your friends and family. Or third, you can accept your bid and become the newest member of the Alpha Sigma Phi 2023 Fall Pledge Class. With these three options, what do you feel like doing here today?"

*80% of the time they hold their bid so be expecting that*

"Yeah man, totally understand. Joining a fraternity is a big decision and you don't want to take it lightly, that's why you give you a week to think it over. We're not the type of guys that are like "accept your bid in 2 minutes or you're fucked". We want you to feel like joining is the right decision for you. That's why we're cool with you checking out other fraternities. At the end of the day we want what's best for you. 

*talk about dues and boring things*
