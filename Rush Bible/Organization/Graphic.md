The goals for the graphic should be to be readable, informative and clean, in that order. Don't go crazy with 9 different colors on the graphic. You want something simple and clean. 

Remember that people are going to be reading your graphic on their phone screen. When you're in photoshop, its easy to obsess over small details.  I reccomend bouncing your rough drafts to a png and looking at it on your phone to get a different perspective of what it actually looks like.

### What should the Graphic actually be?

If you are lacking inspiration, don't feel bad about stealing other people's designs. Go on google and look at all the different frat rush schedules from other colleges. This graphic is only going to exist for one semester. No one gives a shit if it's a rip off of another graphic if it looks good. 

A classic graphic is to take a HD pic of the house and then add a color filter over it and then add text.
